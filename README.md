# WDD01 Challenge X

Template repos for WDD01 challenges.

## Getting Started

Same as the other daily challenges. Git `fork` and `clone` this repository.

### Challenge Brief


## Start the Web Server

The challenge requires the local dev webserver.

Run the following commands in the CLI to start the webserver:

```shell
# install the server dependencies
npm install
# start the webserver
npm start
```

Now the webserver is started, you should be able to send HTTP requests to the webserver.

The code for this challenge should go into `/Submission/static/js/script.js`.

## Challenge Part A - ...

# Submit the Challenge

Same workflow as the other challenges.

Git `add`, `commit`, `push`, then create a `pull request`.

# Git CLI Refresher

Remember to `fork` the repository first!!!

Then you can follow the shell commands below:

```shell
# example git clone command - replace this URL with your repo's URL
git clone git@github.com:YOU_REPO/WDD01-Challenge-XX.git

# make sure to change directory into the cloned directory
cd WDD01-Challenge-XX

# open VS Code
code .

# start coding ...

# when ready to commit and push
git add .

git commit -m "Challenge XX ..."

git push origin pilot
```

Don't forget to open a `pull request` on the GitHub web app after you've pushed your code.
